  /* Calculate the hexagon width based on the viewport's minimum dimension
     The `vmin` CSS unit represents 1 percent of the viewport's minimum dimension,
     which is the smaller of the viewport's width or height.
     The simplified board has a maximum of 5
     hexagons in the middle row. Dividing by 6 (instead of 5) provides extra space
     around the board for margins and ensures that the board doesn't touch the edges
     of the viewport. This prevents overflow and potential scrollbars, enhancing the
     user experience. */
